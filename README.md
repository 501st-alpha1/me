# Repos

## My Projects
These are open source projects that I have started, with the intent to be used more widely (though some may still be incomplete).

TODO: Add repos.

## Examples and Interview Projects
These are projects that were written either for fun or as part of an interview, and are published here to give examples of how I write and manage code.

TODO: Add repos.

## Personal Configs
These are personal config files and scripts for various programs.  While I publish them here on GitHub, I don't expect them to be used widely (though I have no problem if they are).  The more likely use is someone may be looking for a solution to a specific problem and find it in one of these repos.

TODO: Add repos.

## Forks
Most forks are made with the intent to submit PRs against upstream, but I'll note here if they have any other uses.
