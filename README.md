## My Projects
These are open source projects that I have started, with the intent to be used more widely (though some may still be incomplete).

| Name / Link | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [Big Gollum](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/big-gollum) | A rails app that lets you make, browse, edit, and eventually control permission to gollum wikis. |
| [Codeception Data Selector](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/codeception-data-selector) | A Codeception extension to automatically select data from DB based on certain conditions. |
| [Emacs Org EBS](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/emacs-org-ebs) | An Emacs Org-Mode implementation of Joel Spolsky's Evidence-Based Scheduling. |

TODO: Add repos.

## Examples and Interview Projects
These are projects that were written either for fun or as part of an interview, and are published here to give examples of how I write and manage code.

| Name / Link | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [rpn-calculator](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/rpn-calculator) | A command-line Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) calculator, written as part of the On-Site interview process. |

## Personal Configs
These are personal config files and scripts for various programs.  While I publish them here on GitHub, I don't expect them to be used widely (though I have no problem if they are).  The more likely use is someone may be looking for a solution to a specific problem and find it in one of these repos.

| Name / Link | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [emacs-init](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/emacs-init) | Public portion of my configuration for Emacs. |
| [git-template](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/git-template) | Template for new `.git` folders. |
| [i3wm-config](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/i3wm-config) | My config for the [i3 window manager](//i3wm.org) |
| [scott-script](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/scott-script) | Various Bash scripts that I use.  Some of them may be useful for wider audiences, but those should probably be extracted to separate repos eventually. |
| [scott-server-scripts](https://github.com/501st-alpha1/scott-server-scripts) | Same as above but for scripts that I only need on servers. |

## Forks
Most forks are made with the intent to submit PRs against upstream, but I'll note here if they have any other uses.
